Controller File :
The program serves to control the dual-axis solar tracker system, consisting of 4 LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) sensors and 2 servo motors. The LDR sensors function to detect the intensity of light hitting each sensor, and compare the difference in value between the sensors. Based on this comparison, the servo motor will adjust the position of the tracker horizontally and vertically to direct the solar panel to the light source optimally.

Measurment file :
This program functions to read data from the sensor and send the reading results to the backend web side.
